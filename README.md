# OpenVPN Config Splitter
Network Manager's OpenVPN Import feature doesn't accept an inline configuration file. Which is
really annoying, because inline configurations are the easiest to distribute. This script will parse
an inline config, move all the bits into a folder and generate an importable config. I've only
tested it with the files generated by the pfSense OpenVPN Client Export Utility, but it should
pretty much work on any valid OpenVPN file.



## Dependencies
Make sure to install network-manager-openvpn-gnome, Debian Jessie does not install it by default.

```sudo apt install network-manager-openvpn-gnome```

## Usage
To use, first install the dependencies:
```sudo apt install network-manager-openvpn-gnome```
Then clone the repo:
```git clone https://github.com/thefinn93/OpenVPN-Config-Splitter```
```cd OpenVPN-Config-Splitter```
Then, run the script:
```python split.py <YOUR_.OVPN_FILE_HERE>```
And finally add the VPN to Network Manager:
Click on/Bump Activities, type & click on network, press the + button in lower left corner and choose VPN, then choose "Import from file..." and select the file the prior step told you to pick in its output. At this point a filled out OpenVPN profile should pop up, press Save, then test it!

## todo
* Automatically import into Network Manager, maybe using [this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/237886) method
* A proper configuration file
* Maybe some automatic self-extracting magic so it can all be sent as one file. "Run this script to get on the VPN"
